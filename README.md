    Monitors FER iCal calendars and notifies students by email whenever a change is detected.

- **Easy Subscription:**
    Students simply paste their FER calendar URL to subscribe.

- **Secure & Privacy-Respecting:**
    No unecessary data is collected. All sensitive operations are protected and GDPR-friendly.

- **Internationalization:**
    Fully localized in Croatian and English.

- **University API:**
    FER administration can securely manage subscriptions (add, remove, pause, resume, query) via a protected API.
