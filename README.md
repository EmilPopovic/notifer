## ‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting & Deployment

### Quick Start - From Source (Docker compose)

1. **Install Docker:**
    [Official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EmilPopovic/notifer.git
    cd notifer
    ```

3. **Configure environment:**

    Edit `.env.example` and `config/app.conf` as needed, then rename:

    ```bash
    mv .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Run the service:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d
    ```

5. **Set up a reverse proxy (optional):**
    The app runs on port 8026.

### Quick Start - From Registry (Docker compose)

**This is the recommended deployment method for production environments.**

1. **Install Docker:**
    [Official Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. **Download and run the deployment script:**

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmilPopovic/NotiFER/refs/heads/master/deploy.sh | bash
    ```

    Or manually download and execute:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmilPopovic/NotiFER/refs/heads/master/deploy.sh
    chmod +x deploy.sh
    ./deploy.sh
    ```

3. **Configure environment:**

    The script creates a `notifer/` directory with all necessary files. Edit the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cd notifer
    nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
    ```

    **Required configuration:**
    - Email settings (RESEND_API_KEY or SMTP credentials)
    - Database password (POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
    - Storage password (S3_PASSWORD)  
    - JWT secret key (JWT_KEY)
    - API base URL (API_URL)
    - Admin API token hash (NOTIFER_API_TOKEN_HASH)

4. **Deploy:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

**What gets deployed:**

- Pre-built Docker images from Docker Hub
- Complete monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager)
- Automated database backups
- All configuration files and directory structure

**Deployment structure:**

```bash
notifer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compose.yaml          # Main deployment file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Your configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.conf         # Application settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring/          # Monitoring configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ db_backups/         # Database backup location
```
