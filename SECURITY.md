## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please report it privately** to the maintainer:

- **Email:** [admin@emilpopovic.me](mailto:admin@emilpopovic.me)

Do **not** create public GitHub issues for security problems.
We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

## Security Features

- **API Authentication:**
  All administrative endpoints require a secure Bearer token. The token hash is stored in environment variables and never in code or logs.

- **Email Confirmation:**
  All sensitive student actions (activation, deletion, pause/resume) require confirmation via a unique, expiring email token.

- **Data Minimization:**
  Only essential data is stored (email, calendar auth, language, status). No unnecessary personal information is collected.

- **GDPR-Friendly:**
  Users can delete their data at any time. No tracking or analytics are performed.

- **Rate Limiting:**
  Rate limiting is available to prevent abuse on email-sending endpoints.

- **Open Source:**
  The codebase is fully open for audit by any interested party.

---

## Deployment Recommendations

- **Use HTTPS:**
  Always deply behind a secure reverse proxy with HTTPS enabled.

- **Protect API Tokens:**
  Stor API tokens and secrets in environment variables or secure secrets managers.
  Never commit secrets to version control.

- **Update Regularly:**
  Keep NotiFER and all dependencies up to date to receive security patches.

- **Restrict Access:**
  Limit access to the admin API endpoints to trusted systems/networks.

- **Monitor Logs and Metrics:**
  Regularly review logs and metrics for unusual activity.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security issues.
If you have questions or concerns about NotiFER's security, please contact the maintainer directly.
